# sbdm

sbdm, or SpecialBomb's Death Match, is a mod that is aimed at making all of the weapons useful in their own way.
For example, if you had the Nailgun, and got the Super Nailgun, why would you want to use the Nailgun anymore?
This mod tries to fix that.

Weapon changes:

+The Axe now does 80 damage, making it a viable melee weapon.

+The Nailgun now throws nails, and they stick to the map. If they are touched by a player, they get damaged by it. The nails last a minute until they disappear, and can be destroyed using explosives.

+The Shotgun is now infinitly accurate, and does more damage. This is useful in long range encounters with enemies.

+The Double-Barreled Shotgun has a square spread rather than a rectangular one, and does more damage. It also has kickback, which can be used for stopping in midair, or boosting jumps.

+The Super Nailgun no longer shoots nails, but rather acts like the Doom Chaingun.

Gameplay changes:

+The Quad and Ring now drop on death.

+There is no longer any automatic weapon switching, besides switching on low ammo.

+Instagib axes can be enabled with "deathmatch 3". Disables item pickups, and spawns player with only an axe. The axe will do 1000 damage.

+Random spawns.

+Grenades aren't random.

+If someone were to hit you, and you fall into water, slime, or lava and die within 3 seconds, a frag will go to the attacker. (Essentially, you push someone into lava, you get a frag).

Other changes:

+While standing still, you can look at a player to see their name.

+Drowning doesn't damage armor.

Other things will be added at some point.
