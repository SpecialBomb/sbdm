# sbdm

sbdm, or SpecialBomb's Death Match, is a mod that is aimed at making all of the weapons useful in their own way.
For example, if you had the Nailgun, and got the Super Nailgun, why would you want to use the Nailgun anymore?
This mod tries to fix that.
It also adds more ways to move, and adds different ways of playing.

#Weapon Changes

+The Axe now does 80 damage, making it a viable melee weapon.

+The Nailgun now throws nails, and they stick to the map. If they are touched by a player, they get damaged by it (9 per nail). The nails last a minute until they disappear, and can be destroyed using explosives.

+The Nailgun only allows 30 spikes in the game at a time. There is a nifty number that pops up at the center of your screen telling you how many you have in the level. This number pops up when spikes are created or destroyed.

+If you are adept with the Nailgun, there are two aliases that you would find useful to bind, spikes and dspikes. spikes reports how many spike you currently have. dspikes deletes all of your spikes if you want to replace them, but you won't get your ammo back.

+The Shotgun is now infinitly accurate, and does more damage (40). This is useful in long range encounters with enemies.

+The Double-Barreled Shotgun has a much larger square spread rather than a rectangular one, and does more damage (100). It also has kickback, which can be used for stopping in midair, or boosting jumps.

+The Super Nailgun no longer shoots nails, but rather acts like the Doom Chaingun (does 18 damage)

+The lightning gun is now like a railgun. It does 100 damage per bolt, and uses 10 cells per shot. It takes 1.5 seconds inbetween shots.

+All weapons have no recoil when you shoot them.

#Gameplay Changes

+The Quad and Ring now drop on death. (needs improving)

+There is no longer any automatic weapon switching, besides on low ammo.

+Instagib axes can be enabled with "deathmatch 3". Disables item pickups, and spawns player with only an axe. The axe will do 1000 damage.

+Instagib mode with the railgun can be enabled with "dethamatch 4". Disables item pickups, and you have infinite ammo.

+Random spawns. (needs improving)

+Grenades aren't random.

+Rocket impact damage is always 120.

+Players won't keep weapons, ammo, health, and armor when changing levels.

+If someone were to suicide with a recent attacker, the recent attacker will get the frag.

+The invisibility ring doesn't make your weapons invisible.

+Walljumping! (see below)

#Other Changes

+You can look at a player to see their name.

+Map voting. Maps dm1 to dm6 are voteable, and uses a yes greater than no system (non voters are not counted).

+Drowning doesn't damage armor. (might not be working)

Other things will be added at some point.

#Walljumping

To do walljumps, bind a key (perferrably mouse2) to "impulse 30." You can also bind "walljump" if you want to use the alias. Using the bound key while your back is facing towards a wall, you will jump in the direction you are looking in. This can be useful for finding combos in maps that let you get around quicker than usual. Practice a bit to get used to it, because nothing will happen if you jump at the wrong angle. You can only walljump 3 times until you have to touch the ground again.
